# About This Presentation

This presentation was made with &#10084; using [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/).

- Observable Framework is an open-source static-site generator, predominantly used for data apps
- Here, we're leveraging Observable's built-in Javascript reactivity to define custom interactive components
- The interactive components used here derive from the following "electron ptychography" [collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@gvarnavi/electron-ptychography)
